Just testing out [react-sheltr](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/react-sheltr).
I really like shared element transitions, I think they can make an app look really polished when done correctly.
I found this library pretty easy to use, definitely keeping it in mind for the future.

## Running

To run, install dependencies with `npm i`, then run with `npm start`
